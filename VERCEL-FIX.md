# Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Vercel is looking for a "public" directory but your files are in the root.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Create a public directory (Recommended)
```bash
mkdir public
copy *.html public\
copy *.css public\
copy *.js public\
copy *.md public\
```

### Option 2: Use a simple vercel.json (Current fix)
The vercel.json is now simplified to work with root directory files.

### Option 3: Manual Vercel Settings
In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Under "Build & Output Settings":
   - Build Command: (leave empty)
   - Output Directory: `./` or `.`
   - Install Command: (leave empty)

## Test the deployment again
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Alternative: Deploy without vercel.json
You can also delete vercel.json completely and let Vercel auto-detect your static site.
